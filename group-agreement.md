#Group Agreement

- We all agree to try to keep everyone speaking about the same amount so everyone is heard
- Create an environment that encourages clarification when there's a perceived disagreement. 
- Disagreement is not necessarily conflict, and we see many disagreements as a tool to discuss different approaches. We'll all do our best to keep our egos out of disagreements, and remind ourselves that we all have the same goal of a great final product.
- Using issue tracking, we'll be able to see what areas progress is not being made on. If someone seems stuck, we might suggest pair programming and/or issue clarification.
- If someone's really struggling with an issue, we'll suggest they switch gears to an issue they feel confident they can tackle.

##If someone is really not pulling their weight:

- We'll ensure that both people are talking about the same thing.
- We'll make sure everyone's being heard.
- If step 1 and step 2 are both confirmed, bring the agreement for resolution with the instructors.
