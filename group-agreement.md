#Group Agreement
##Conflict Plan
- We all agree to try to keep everyone speaking about the same amount so everyone is heard
- Create an environment that encourages clarification when there's a perceived disagreement-- Disagreement is not necessarily conflict, and we see many disagreements as a tool to discuss different approaches.
- Using issue tracking, we'll be able to see what areas progress is not being made on. If someone seems stuck, we might suggest pair programming and issue clarification.

In the event that it seems like someone is really not pulling their weight, we'll:
- ensure that both people are talking about the same thing.
- make sure everyone's being heard
- If step 1 and step 2 are both confirmed, bring the agreement to the resolution with the instructors.
