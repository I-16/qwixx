#Personas for Quixx
##Player Jack
Avid Quixx fan Jack has used up all his scorecards for his copy of the game, and just wants a digital scorecard that allows him to easily input his score.

##Player George
George has played a few games and loves the strategy but not the math at the end of each game. They want a digital version that adds up their scores at the end of each round.

##Player Bobby
10-year-old Bobby is learning to play the game and needs to have their input validated. Invalid input should be disabled.

##Player Jan
New Quixx player Jack has never played the game before and could use some assistance figuring out what their options are after each roll.
