# User Stories for Qwixx
## Player Jack
Avid Qwixx fan Jack has used up all his scorecards for his copy of the game, and just wants a digital scorecard that allows him to easily input his score.

## Player George
George has played a few games and loves the strategy but not the math at the end of each game. They want a digital version that adds up their scores at the end of each round.

## Player Bobby
As a young new player, 10-year-old Bobby is learning to play the game and should have their input validated so they don't make illegal moves. Invalid input should be disabled.

## Player Jan
As a new Qwixx player, Jack has never played the game before and wants context-appropriate feedback about their options after each roll.
