# qwixx

A mobile-responsive vanilla JavaScript implementation of the popular Qwixx dice game that speeds gameplay and doesn't waste scorecards. Developed with face-to-face simultaneous multiplayer play in mind, each player should run a copy on their own device so they can score on the rolls of other players as well as their own. Developed in a 4-day code sprint by a team of 4 people.
